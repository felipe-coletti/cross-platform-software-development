### 📁 Semester and Subject Folders
Each semester has its own folder (e.g., `first-semester`), containing subject-specific directories. Each subject may include:
-   **Class activities (`class-001`, `class-002`, etc.)** with individual exercises.
-   **Mini-projects (`mini-projects`)** containing different project-based assignments.
-   **A subject project (subject-project)**, which is typically developed in class along with the professor throughout the semester.

Not all subjects will have all types of folders—some may only have class activities, mini-projects, or a subject project.

Each directory contains a `README.md` with relevant information:
-   Exercises (`class-xxx/exercise-xxx`): Includes a rewritten problem statement, instructions on how to complete the task, and solutions (if applicable).
-   Mini-projects (`mini-projects/mini-project-xxx`): Provides a rewritten problem statement, project description, and the corresponding implementation.
-   Subject projects (`subject-project`): Contains a project overview, materials developed in class, and its implementation (if applicable).

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Navigate** to the corresponding semester and subject folder.
2. **Read** the `README.md` file inside each dynamic folder (`class-001`, `mini-projects`, `subject-project`, etc.).
3. **Complete** the exercises or mini-projects based on the given instructions.
4. **Check solutions** if available.

## 🛠 Requirements
Some activities might require specific software or tools. Please check the activity description for any dependencies or prerequisites.
