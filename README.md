### 📁 Semester and Subject Folders
Each semester has its own folder (e.g., `first-semester`), containing subject-specific directories. Each subject includes:
-   **Class activities (`class-001`, `class-002`, etc.)** with individual exercises.
-   **Mini-projects (`mini-projects`)** containing different project-based assignments.

Each exercise and mini-project has a `README.md` that includes:
-   A **rewritten problem statement**, ensuring clarity and avoiding potential copyright issues.
-   **Instructions** on how to complete the task.
-   **Solutions**, if applicable, to provide guidance.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Navigate** to the corresponding semester and subject folder.
2. **Read** the `README.md` file inside each dynamic folder (`class-001`, `mini-projects`, etc.).
3. **Complete** the exercises or mini-projects based on the given instructions.
4. **Check solutions** if available.

## 🛠 Requirements
Some activities might require specific software or tools. Please check the activity description for any dependencies or prerequisites.
